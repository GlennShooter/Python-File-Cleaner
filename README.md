# Python-File-Cleaner
This program takes in a json file which gives instructions on the name of a file and the proccesses you would like to run on the file. 
The code is stored in the cleaner.py file and a sample json input file is also shown.
Currently the regulare expression part of this project is not working properly i aim to fix this soon.
